# Loan Approval Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan approval data to identify key factors influencing loan decisions. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning models to predict loan status.

## Goals and Scope
- Understand the key factors affecting loan approval.
- Build predictive models to forecast loan approval outcomes.

## Repository Structure

```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Loan-Approval_Project.ipynb` to see the analysis and results.

## Dependencies
The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the `data/` directory. The data includes various attributes of loan applicants, such as income, credit history, and more.

## Key Findings
- Factors like applicant income, loan amount, and credit history play a significant role in loan approval.
- Further analysis and feature engineering can improve model performance.
